exploratory experiment
for two different RRT algorithm implementations:
what is the correlation between epsilon and jointspace path length?
what is the correlation between epsilon and RRT execution time?

So is there a correlation, basically? (YES!)
We have non-normal data (we can see from the plots),
but clearly there is a relationship.
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, which checks for non linear correlation.


Define:
The best measure of algorithm efficiency is (jointspace path length  *  RRT execution time).
Optimal epsilon of the algorithm is min(jointspace path length  *  RRT execution time)

By using the medians, which are insensitive to outliers,
for each algorithm,
find the optimal epsilon.
This is just an intermediate step for the next algorithm.


Comparative experiment
Hypothesis: Algorithm 1 is as efficient as algorithm 2, when they each use their optimal epsilon.
So do they have the same mean?!

So perform lots of trials with algorithm 1 | optimal epsilon 1
and perform lots of trials with algorithm 2 | optimal epsilon 2

this way, if it looks normally distributed, we have enough samples to say that it F*'in IS!

Is the data (algorithm efficiency) normally distributed?
QQplot for each algorithm.


Do they have the same variance? F-test
 // // // // // (if normal, Bartlett. If not, Levene's test) what am i

If they have the same variance
  Z-test (do they have the same fucking mean)????
  // // // // // student's t test?!?!?!? This is when both are normally dist, and have the same variance
If they don't have the same variance (this is very likely, if optimal epsilons are different!)
  Welch's t-test (they are still normally distributed)

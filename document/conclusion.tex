\section{Conclusion} 
The jointspace distance traveled \(d_J\) by the serial robot was
found to correlate with the RRT extension step parameter \(\epsilon\).
\(H_{0,corr}\) is rejected.
The values of \(\epsilon\) yielding the smallest \(d_J\) for the
bidirectional and balanced bidirectional RRT algorithms
were found to be 2.25 and 2.15 jointspace units respectively.
A general tendency for the bidirectional RRT planner
to yield smaller \(d_J\) was observed, and it was hypthesized
that the bidirectional RRT planner would yield smaller \(d_J\)
than the balanced bidirectional RRT, when both algorithms
were configured with optimal \(\epsilon\).

Using the found values of \(\epsilon\),
jointspace distances \(d_J\) of the different algorithms were compared
using Welch's t-test. With a p-value of \(0.042\),
no algorithm yielded significantly shorter \(d_J\) than the other.
\(H_{0,comp}\) is accepted.

\section{Conclusion} 
The jointspace distance traveled \(d_J\) by the serial robot was
found to correlate with the RRT extension step parameter \(\epsilon\).
The values of \(\epsilon\) yielding the smallest \(d_J\) for the
bidirectional and balanced bidirectional RRT algorithms
were found to be 2.25 and 2.15 jointspace units respectively.
Using these values, \(d_J\) of the different algorithms were compared,
and it was found that the bidirectional RRT algorithm yielded
smaller distances than the balanced RRT algorithm.
The hypothesis that the balanced bidirectional RRT algorithm
would yield smaller distances for its optimal \(\epsilon\) than
the bidirectional RRT algorithm is rejected.

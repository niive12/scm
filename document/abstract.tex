The bi\-directional and balanced bi\-directional Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms
for serial robot path planning are compared in the RobWork \citep{robwork} environment.
The correlation between the tree expansion parameter \(\epsilon\)
and the jointspace distance traveled is investigated for each algorithm.
Based on the results of this investigation,
an optimal \(\epsilon\) is chosen for each algorithm,
and the algorithms are compared with respect
to distance traveled in jointspace.
It is concluded that, for the given configuration,
the bidirectional RRT algorithm yields
a smaller jointspace distance traveled 
than the balanced bidirectional RRT,
each with their optimal \(\epsilon\) parameters.

\begin{abstract}
The bidirectional and balanced bidirectional Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms
for serial robot path finding are compared in the RobWork environment.
Each of these algorithms takes a parameter \(\epsilon\), which defines the aggresiveness of the algorithm.
For each algorithm, the optimal value of this parameter is found with respect
to the total joint space distance traveled by the simulated serial robot.
The algorithms, as implemented in RobWork, are compared with their optimal \(\epsilon\) values.
It is concluded that the bidirectional RRT algorithm yields
a smaller joint space distance traveled 
than the balanced bidirectional RRT,
each with their optimal \(\epsilon\) parameters.

\begin{abstract}
The bidirectional and balanced bidirectional Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms
for serial robot path finding are compared in a simulated environment.
Each of these algorithms take a parameter \(\epsilon\), which defines the aggresiveness of the algorithm.
For each algorithm, the optimal value of this parameter is found with respect
to the total joint space distance traveled by the simulated serial robot.
The algorithms are compared with their optimal \(\epsilon\) values
using the RobWork implementations of the algorithms and the RobWorkSim
simulation environment.
It is concluded that the bidirectional RRT algorithm yields
a smaller joint space distance traveled 
than the balanced bidirectional RRT,
each with their optimal \(\epsilon\) parameters.

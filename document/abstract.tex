\begin{abstract}
The bidirectional and balanced bidirectional Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms
for serial robot path finding are compared in the RobWork environment.
%methods
It is concluded that the bidirectional RRT algorithm yields
a smaller joint space distance traveled 
than the balanced bidirectional RRT,
each with their optimal \(\epsilon\) parameters.
